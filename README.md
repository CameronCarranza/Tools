Tools
=====

Just a clone of my Windows tools directory, primarily just a customized Powershell profile w/ some Scripts.

If you are trying to clone and use everything, it will function best when placed as C:\Tools, some dependencies may still be unsatisfied but most should be included.

Also has a Minitab 17 Remote Desktop Bypass Powershell script (requires Owexec) to allow you to run Minitab 17 over Remote Desktop when it is normally prohibited.
